## Compatibility
 
The first thing you need to check is whether the media player you want to use is compatible with the Tomb Raider games you have. Some older games may require specific codecs or formats that are not supported by newer media players, or vice versa. For example, Tomb Raider (1996) used CD audio tracks for its soundtrack, which may not play on some modern media players. Tomb Raider II (1997) used a custom format called TR2 for its cutscenes, which may not be recognized by some media players. Tomb Raider: The Curse of the Sword (2001) was a Game Boy Color exclusive game that used a different resolution and color palette than other games in the series.
 
To avoid compatibility issues, you should look for a media player that can play a wide range of formats and codecs, such as VLC Media Player or KMPlayer. These media players can handle most common and uncommon formats, including TR2, MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, MKV, MP4, AVI, WMV, and more. They also have built-in codecs that can decode and encode various audio and video streams without requiring additional downloads or installations.
 
## Performance
 
The next thing you need to consider is how well the media player can run the Tomb Raider games without lagging, stuttering, or crashing. Some games may have high system requirements or use advanced graphics and sound effects that can strain your PC's resources. For example, Tomb Raider (2013) used a new engine called Crystal Engine that featured realistic physics, dynamic lighting, and environmental destruction. Tomb Raider (2023) used Epic Online Services for its multiplayer infrastructure, which required a stable internet connection and online authentication.
 
To ensure smooth performance, you should look for a media player that can optimize your PC's settings and resources for gaming. Some media players have special modes or features that can enhance your gaming experience, such as Game Mode or Boost Mode. These modes can adjust your PC's priority, memory usage, CPU usage, GPU usage, and network settings to give more power and speed to your games. They can also disable unnecessary background processes, notifications, or pop-ups that can interfere with your gaming.
 
## Features
 
The third thing you need to look for is what features the media player can offer to improve your Tomb Raider experience. Some games may have extra content or options that you want to access or customize with your media player. For example, Tomb Raider: Anniversary (2007) had an unlockable commentary mode that let you listen to the developers' insights on each level. Tomb Raider: Underworld (2008) had a downloadable content pack called Beneath the Ashes that added a new level and outfit for Lara. Tomb Raider: Shadow of the Tomb Raider (2018) had a photo mode that let you take screenshots and edit them with filters and stickers.
 
To enjoy these features, you should look for a media player that can support them or add them to your games. Some media players have built-in tools or plugins that can enhance your games with extra functions or options. For example, GOM Player has a subtitle finder that can search and download subtitles for your games from online databases. MPC-HC has a shader editor that can apply various effects and filters to your games' graphics. PotPlayer has a screen capture tool that can take screenshots or record videos of your games.
