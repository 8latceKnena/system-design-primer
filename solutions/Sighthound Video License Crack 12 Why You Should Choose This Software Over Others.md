Sighthound Video is a smart video camera DVR software that enables almost any standards-based security camera to see people, vehicles, animals, and other objects just like the human brain. It can alert you when something important happens, record video clips, and integrate with other smart home devices. But how do you choose the right Sighthound Video license for your needs?
 
Sighthound Video offers four different license options: Starter, Basic, Home, and Pro. Each license has different features and limitations, so you need to consider your budget, the number of cameras you want to use, the resolution of your cameras, and the remote access and integration options you need. Here is a brief overview of each license:

## How Sighthound Video Works
 
Sighthound Video uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the video streams from your cameras and detect objects of interest. It can recognize people, vehicles, animals, and other objects with high accuracy and speed. It can also distinguish between different types of vehicles, such as cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bicycles. It can even read license plates and faces if you have the Pro license.
 
Sighthound Video allows you to create custom rules for each camera and object type. For example, you can set up a rule to send you an email or a push notification when a person enters your driveway, or when a vehicle with a specific license plate is detected. You can also set up a rule to record a video clip or take a snapshot when an object of interest is detected. You can view the recorded clips and snapshots in the Sighthound Video app or on the web interface.
