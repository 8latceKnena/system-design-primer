### How to play the single-player campaign
 
The single-player campaign is a great way to learn the basics of Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne. It consists of four campaigns, each with its own storyline and missions. You will control one of the five factions in each campaign: the Sentinels (Night Elves), the Alliance (Humans), the Scourge (Undead), the Horde (Orcs) or the Naga (a new race introduced in the expansion).
 
The campaign will teach you how to use each faction's units, heroes, buildings and abilities. It will also introduce you to different types of maps, objectives and enemies. You will face various challenges, such as defending your base, escorting allies, destroying enemy structures, solving puzzles and more.
 
To play the campaign, select "Single Player" from the main menu, then choose "Campaign". You can select any campaign you want, but we recommend playing them in order: Sentinels, Alliance, Scourge and Bonus. You can also adjust the difficulty level from easy to hard.
 
If you need help with any mission, you can consult online guides such as IGN[^1^] or GameSpot[^2^]. They provide detailed walkthroughs for each mission, as well as tips and secrets. You can also use cheat codes if you get stuck or want to have some fun. To enter a cheat code, press Enter during gameplay, type the code and press Enter again. For example, typing "whosyourdaddy" will make your units invincible and able to kill enemies in one hit. To see a list of all cheat codes, check out our Cheat Codes section.
