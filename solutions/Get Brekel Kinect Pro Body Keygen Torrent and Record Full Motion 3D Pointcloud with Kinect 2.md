## Some Examples of PDS 2000 Applications
 
To give you a better idea of what PDS 2000 can do, here are some examples of PDS 2000 applications for different types of marine projects.
 
### Pile Placement Using Grippers
 
This is an extension of the existing PDS 2000 pile drive application. In this method, the pile is placed in grippers and the position of the pile is measured by laser scanners. PDS 2000 calculates the position, depth and inclination of the pile, to visualize, guide and register the pile placement. This application can be used for offshore wind farm construction, bridge construction and other projects that require precise pile placement.
 
### Vibratory Pile Drive Support
 
This is another extension of the existing PDS 2000 pile drive application. In this method, an excavator pile vibratory drill drives the pile into the ground. PDS 2000 can calculate the position, depth and inclination of the pile, to visualize, guide and register the pile placement. This application can be used for projects that require fast and efficient pile driving, such as port construction, coastal protection and more.

### Jet Dredge Application Dual Pipe and Calibration
 
This is a new application for PDS 2000 that supports jet dredging with dual pipes. Jet dredging is a method of dredging that uses high-pressure water jets to loosen and remove sediment from the seabed. PDS 2000 can monitor and control the position and orientation of the jet dredge pipes, as well as calibrate the water pressure and flow rate. This application can be used for projects that require accurate and selective dredging, such as environmental dredging, mining dredging and more.
