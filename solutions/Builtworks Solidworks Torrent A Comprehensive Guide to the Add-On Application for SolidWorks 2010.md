In this article, we will show you how to use some of the basic features of BuiltWorks for SolidWorks. We will create a simple portal frame model and generate some drawings and reports from it. To follow along, you will need to have SolidWorks 2023 and BuiltWorks 2022 installed on your computer.
 
## Creating a Portal Frame Model
 
To create a portal frame model, follow these steps:

1. Launch SolidWorks and create a new part document.
2. Go to the BuiltWorks tab and click on the New Model icon. This will open the New Model dialog box.
3. Enter a name for your model and choose a unit system. You can also choose a default material and section library from the drop-down menus. Click OK to create the model.
4. Go to the Sketch tab and click on the 3D Sketch icon. This will allow you to draw lines in 3D space.
5. Draw four vertical lines at the origin, each 4 m long. These will be the columns of the portal frame.
6. Draw two horizontal lines at the top of the columns, each 6 m long. These will be the rafters of the portal frame.
7. Draw two diagonal lines connecting the ends of the rafters. These will be the braces of the portal frame.
8. Exit the sketch mode by clicking on the Exit Sketch icon.

You have now created a 3D sketch of the portal frame. Next, we will convert the sketch lines into structural members using BuiltWorks.
