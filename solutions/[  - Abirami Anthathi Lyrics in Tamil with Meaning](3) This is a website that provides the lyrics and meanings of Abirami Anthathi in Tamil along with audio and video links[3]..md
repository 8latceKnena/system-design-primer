The king, who was angry at his mistake, ordered him to be executed if there was no full moon that night. Abirami Pattar then prayed to his beloved Goddess to save him from this predicament. She appeared before him and threw her earring into the sky, which shone like a full moon. The king was astonished by this miracle and apologized to Abirami Pattar for his mistake.
