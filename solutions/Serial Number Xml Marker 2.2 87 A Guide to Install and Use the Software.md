# XML Marker: A Free XML and JSON Editor
 
XML Marker is a software tool that allows you to edit and view XML and JSON data in a synchronized table-tree-and-text display. It is useful for working with large and complex XML files, as it can automatically produce a tabular display of any selected tag by collecting repeating attribute and tag names and then arranging them into columns. The result is a clutter-free and informative tabular display that makes it easy to compare and analyze the data.

1. Download and install XML Marker from [http://symbolclick.com/](http://symbolclick.com/) or from other sources[^2^] . You can try it for free for 30 days, and then buy it for $125 if you like it.
2. Open XML Marker and select File > Open to open an XML or JSON file. You can also drag and drop a file into the XML Marker window.
3. You will see three views of your data: a tree view on the left, a table view on the top right, and a text view on the bottom right. You can resize and rearrange the views as you wish.
4. You can select any node in the tree view or any cell in the table view, and the corresponding text will be highlighted in the text view. You can also edit the text directly in the text view, and the changes will be reflected in the other views.
5. You can sort the table view by clicking on any column header. You can also filter the table view by using the Branch Selector tool at the bottom left. The Branch Selector allows you to select a subset of nodes based on their tag names or attributes.
6. You can use the syntax-highlighting editor to make your code more readable and easier to edit. You can also use the automatic indentation and pretty-printing features to format your code.
7. You can use the syntax checking feature to find and fix any errors in your code. XML Marker will show you a red underline for any invalid syntax, and a yellow underline for any well-formedness errors. You can hover over the underline to see a tooltip with more details.
8. You can use bookmarks to mark important locations in your code. You can set a bookmark by pressing Ctrl+F2, and you can cycle through your bookmarks by pressing F2. You can also see all your bookmarks in the Bookmarks menu.
9. You can convert your XML data to a spreadsheet format by using the Convert to Spreadsheet tool in the Tools menu. This will create a CSV file that you can open with Excel or other spreadsheet applications.

XML Marker is a powerful and versatile tool that can help you work with XML and JSON data more efficiently and effectively. You can learn more about XML Marker by reading its documentation[^3^] or by following some tutorials[^4^].
