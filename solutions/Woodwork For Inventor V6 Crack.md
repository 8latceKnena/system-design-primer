- **Skeletal modeling**: Woodwork for Inventor is built around the skeletal modeling design approach, which is ideal for the rapid prototyping nature of panel design. Users can create parametric models of furniture components using sketches, parameters, and constraints. The models can be easily modified and updated according to design changes.
- **iBox technology**: iBox is a unique feature of Woodwork for Inventor that allows users to create and use pre-defined assemblies with woodworking functionality built into them. iBox assemblies can be stretched, shrunk, rotated, mirrored, and copied according to the design conditions that users set. Users can also create their own iBox library with their standard products and components.
- **Wood material management**: Woodwork for Inventor is highly flexible in wood material management, allowing users to work with various material profiles and cover material types. Users can define their own materials and assign them to components using drag-and-drop or automatic methods. Woodwork for Inventor also calculates the material consumption and cost for each component and assembly.
- **Hardware items library**: Woodwork for Inventor provides a unified hardware items library with automated component placement, automatic sculpt and subtraction for hole fittings and connection joints. Users can choose from a variety of hardware items such as hinges, handles, slides, connectors, etc., or create their own custom items. Woodwork for Inventor also generates hardware lists and reports.
- **Furniture design BOM**: Woodwork for Inventor automatically generates furniture design industry-tailored BOM (Bill of Materials) based on the model information. Users can customize the BOM layout, content, and format according to their preferences and standards. The BOM can be exported to Excel or other formats.
- **Drawings generation**: Woodwork for Inventor automatically generates drawings of components and assemblies based on predefined templates. Users can edit and annotate the drawings as needed. The drawings are linked to the model data and update automatically when changes occur.
- **CNC programs**: Woodwork for Inventor can generate CNC programs for nested-based manufacturing of panel components. Users can specify the base point of the part and apply drilling, milling, pocketing, and cutting operations. The system automatically selects the necessary geometry for each operation, but manual selection is also possible. The system also configures the lathes and organizes the CNC program file according to their capabilities. Woodwork for Inventor can generate files for Woodwop, Master Wood CAM systems, or G-code format.
