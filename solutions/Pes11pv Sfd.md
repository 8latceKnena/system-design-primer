Pes11pv sfd is not the only file format that is used by Pro Evolution Soccer 2011. The game also uses other file extensions like pes11cl\_a sfd, pes11ci sfd, and pes11el\_a img. These files contain different types of data, such as audio, graphics, and animations. However, like pes11pv sfd, these files are also difficult to open or edit with common software.
 
Some users have tried to modify these files to customize the game or to create patches or mods. For example, some users have changed the game's language, logos, or player names by editing the files. However, this may require some advanced skills and tools, and may also violate the game's license agreement. Therefore, it is not recommended to tamper with these files unless you know what you are doing.
 
Pes11pv sfd and other file formats used by Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 are examples of proprietary formats that are designed for a specific purpose and application. They are not meant to be opened or edited by other software or users. They are part of the game's internal structure and functionality, and they may change or become obsolete in future versions of the game. Therefore, unless you have a valid reason and permission to access these files, it is better to leave them alone.
  
So, what can you do if you want to enjoy Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 without worrying about pes11pv sfd and other file formats? One option is to play the game on a console, such as PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360. These devices can run the game smoothly and without any compatibility issues. However, this may require you to buy the game disc and the console, which may be expensive or unavailable.
 
Another option is to play the game on a PC, but with an emulator. An emulator is a software that can mimic the functions and features of a console on a computer. This way, you can play the game as if you were using a console, but with the advantages of a PC, such as better graphics, faster loading, and more customization options. However, this may also require some technical knowledge and configuration, and may also violate the game's license agreement. Therefore, it is not recommended to use an emulator unless you have a legal copy of the game and the console.
 
Pes11pv sfd and other file formats used by Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 are part of the game's design and development. They are not meant to be accessed or modified by users or other software. They are only useful for the game itself and for its creators. Therefore, if you want to play the game and have fun, you should respect these files and their purpose.
