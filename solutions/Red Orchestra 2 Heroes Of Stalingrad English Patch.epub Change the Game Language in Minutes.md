- Use cover and concealment wisely. The game is very realistic and unforgiving, so you can die from one or two shots if you expose yourself too much. Use walls, windows, doors, trenches, craters, bushes, and other objects to hide from enemy fire and to surprise your enemies. However, be aware that some cover can be destroyed by explosives or heavy weapons, and that some concealment can be seen through by using binoculars or scopes.
- Communicate with your team. The game has a built-in voice chat system that allows you to talk to your squad, your team, or your commander. You can also use text chat or quick commands to relay information or orders. Communication is essential for coordinating attacks, defending objectives, calling for reinforcements, requesting artillery or air support, spotting enemies, and warning about dangers. You can also use the map to see the positions of your allies and enemies, as well as the objectives and their status.
- Choose your role and weapon carefully. The game has a class-based system that limits the number of players who can use certain roles and weapons. Each role has its own advantages and disadvantages, as well as its own responsibilities and tasks. For example, riflemen are the backbone of the infantry, but they have limited firepower and range; machine gunners can suppress enemies with their high rate of fire, but they are slow and vulnerable when reloading or moving; snipers can kill enemies from afar, but they have poor close combat abilities and need a good spotter; commanders can call in support and give orders, but they need a radio operator nearby and a clear view of the target. Each weapon also has its own characteristics, such as accuracy, recoil, damage, rate of fire, magazine size, reload time, etc. You should choose a role and a weapon that suits your playstyle and the situation.
- Learn the maps and the modes. The game has several maps that are based on real locations and events of the Battle of Stalingrad. Each map has its own layout, terrain, objectives, weather, time of day, etc. You should familiarize yourself with the maps and learn their features, such as choke points, sniping spots, flanking routes, hiding places, etc. You should also know the modes that are available for each map. The game has three main modes: Territory, Countdown, and Firefight. In Territory mode, you have to capture or defend a series of objectives until one team runs out of reinforcements or time. In Countdown mode, you have to capture or defend one objective at a time within a limited time frame. In Firefight mode, you have to kill as many enemies as possible until one team runs out of reinforcements.
- Practice and have fun. The game has a steep learning curve and can be frustrating at times. You may die a lot before you get used to the mechanics and the gameplay. However, you should not give up or rage quit. Instead, you should practice and improve your skills by playing against bots in single-player mode or against other players in multiplayer mode. You should also have fun and enjoy the game for what it is: a realistic and immersive simulation of one of the most brutal battles in history.
