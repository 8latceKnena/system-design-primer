If you're wondering whether Warriors: Legends of Troy is worth downloading, you might want to check out some of the reviews from critics and players. The game received mixed reviews, with some praising its gore and graphics, and others criticizing its gameplay and technical issues. Here are some of the pros and cons of Warriors: Legends of Troy according to the reviews:
 
## Pros

- The game has gory kill animations that show blood and limbs flying everywhere. If you enjoy brutal combat and visceral violence, you'll love this aspect of the game[^2^] [^3^].
- The game has a screen-clearing "Fury" mode that lets you unleash powerful attacks and slow down time. This mode can be very satisfying and useful when you're surrounded by enemies[^3^].
- The game has a Trojan War setting that is different from the usual Dynasty Warriors games. The story is based on Homer's epic poem, The Iliad, and features famous characters like Achilles, Hector, Paris, and Helen. The game also has some beautiful art and narration that enhance the atmosphere[^2^].

## Cons

- The game has shallow combat that relies mostly on button-mashing. Most of the enemies are easy to kill and pose little challenge. The combos are simple and repetitive, and the objectives are tedious. The game can get boring and frustrating after a while[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].
- The game has technical issues that affect its performance. The game suffers from frame rate drops, screen tearing, glitches, and long loading times. The game also has poor voice acting and sound effects that detract from the immersion[^1^] [^2^].
- The game has no incentive to play for a long time. The game has a short campaign that can be completed in a few hours. The game has no multiplayer mode or online features. The game has an Arena mode that lets you fight waves of enemies, but it's repetitive and boring[^1^].

In conclusion, Warriors: Legends of Troy is a hack and slash game that might appeal to fans of the genre or the mythology, but it's not a very polished or engaging game. You might want to try it out if you're curious, but don't expect too much from it.
